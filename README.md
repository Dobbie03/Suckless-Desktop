# Suckless Desktop

My Suckless Desktop, a lot of testing and trying new things.  

An almost constant work in progress but I haven't made any changes to my [daily use](https://github.com/Dobbie03/Suckless-Desktop/tree/master/dwm) for quite some time so I am pretty sure I might be complete.

## Credit

[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) is a dynamic window manager for X by [suckless](https://suckless.org).  My build has been expanded from this already in depth and amazing [build](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-vanitygaps) by [bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby).  

Thank you to him for the original base to work from.
